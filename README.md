# Test Results Platform

A React-based web application for analyzing JUnit XML test results with comprehensive testing and CI/CD pipeline.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Upload and view test result summaries with interactive charts
- **Failure Analysis**: Detailed analysis of failed tests with filtering capabilities  
- **Progress Tracking**: Track resolution progress for failed tests
- **Report Generation**: Generate PDF reports from test data
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 99 unit and component tests with 98.57% utility coverage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or 20.x
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Code Quality
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lintfix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically

### Testing
- `npm test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI interface

## Testing

This project has comprehensive test coverage with:

- **99 tests** covering unit and component functionality
- **98.57% coverage** on utility functions
- **100% coverage** on core components (App, Dashboard, FileUploader, Navbar, FailureAnalysisPage)
- **Vitest** testing framework with React Testing Library
- **Coverage reporting** with v8 provider

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Utility functions (xmlParser, parseTestPath, formatting)
2. **Component Tests**: React components with mocked dependencies  
3. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --run src/test/App.test.tsx
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) that:

- Runs on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Executes linting and testing
- Generates coverage reports
- Builds the application
- Uploads build artifacts
- Validates 90% coverage threshold

## Coverage Goals

The project maintains high code coverage standards:

- **Lines**: 98.57% (Target: 90%+)
- **Branches**: 75.51% (Target: 90%+) 
- **Functions**: 100% (Target: 90%+)

Core business logic and components achieve 90%+ coverage. Some UI-heavy components like ReportGenerator have lower coverage due to complex PDF generation dependencies.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Vitest** - Testing framework
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing
- **Recharts** - Data visualization
- **jsPDF** - PDF generation

## Contributing

1. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
2. Maintain code coverage above 90%
3. Follow existing code style
4. Add tests for new features
5. Update documentation as needed
